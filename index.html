    <h1>My favorite places to visit</h1>
    <p>In my years of travel, I have found various beautiful places to visit either for their enjoyable activities
        or their peaceful scenery. These are the places that I've gone back to time and again.

            <h1>Kabaru, Kenya</h1>
            <p>This is my hometown and my favorite place on earth. With it's great weather and proximity to Mt. Kenya it is a must tourist place.
                On the way from Nyeri, one is exposed to different wildlife such elephants, babbons, Tagwa forestry and so on. The locals are mostly
                agricultural savants. The air is fresh, I always take a deep breath when I get there and the air is so fresh it instantly clears your brain.

            <h1>Two Rivers, Kenya</h1>
            <p>Two Rivers is my favorite place because it offers the perfect mix of excitement and relaxation. 
                I love browsing through their stores and enjoying some window shopping, and the activities park—with 
                the Ferris wheel and water park—adds a fun and vibrant energy. The peaceful, open space out front creates a calm atmosphere that makes every visit feel refreshing.

            <h1>Ngong Hills, Kenya</h1>
            <p>Ngong Hills is one of my absolute favorite spots in Nairobi for reconnecting with nature and escaping the 
                fast pace of the city. The rolling hills offer a breathtaking panoramic view of the Great Rift Valley on one 
                side and Nairobi city on the other, which always leaves me in awe. I love the refreshing breeze and the sense of 
                freedom that comes with walking along the winding trails. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngong_Hills" target="_blank"> <br>Ngong Hills, Nairobi</a>
