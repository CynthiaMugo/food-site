            <h1>Fiction Novels</h1>
            <p>I love fiction novels because they transport me into different worlds, 
                letting me experience thrilling stories beyond the everyday. I’m especially drawn to the mystery genre—the suspense, 
                the twists, and the thrill of uncovering secrets keep me hooked from start to finish. Authors like Sidney Sheldon and J.D. 
                Robb are my favorites because they blend clever plots with strong, unforgettable characters. T
                heir books always leave me wanting more.

            <h1>Nature walks</h1>
            <p>I enjoy nature walks because they offer a peaceful break from the busyness of life. 
                Walking my dog in the evenings is one of my favorite routines—it’s calming, refreshing, 
                and a perfect way to unwind. The quiet rustle of trees, the cool breeze, and the golden glow of 
                sunset create the kind of serenity that’s hard to find elsewhere. It’s not just a walk—it’s a moment to breathe, 
                reflect, and reconnect with nature.

            <h1>Raising my cat</h1>
            <p>Raising my two ginger cats has been one of the most rewarding parts of my life. They’ve taught me patience, compassion, 
                and the joy of simple, everyday moments. My love for animals extends beyond my home—I've had the privilege of volunteering 
                with KSPCA during their free vaccination and spaying days. It’s incredibly fulfilling to help care for animals in need and 
                support responsible pet ownership in the community. For me, it's more than just volunteering—it's a way of giving back to the 
                voiceless companions who bring so much love into our lives.
